# Project Rules

## Environment
- All commands and scripts should be compatible with Windows operating systems
- Use PowerShell as the primary shell for command execution
- Ensure all paths use Windows-style backslashes (\) or forward slashes (/)
- Use Windows-specific environment variables (e.g., %USERPROFILE% instead of $HOME)
- Consider Windows-specific file permissions and security policies
- Use Windows-compatible line endings (CRLF)

<!-- - Test all commands in PowerShell environment before deployment -->
